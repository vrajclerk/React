The key points are:

In a UI, it's not necessary for every update to be applied immediately;
 in fact, doing so can be wasteful, causing frames to drop and degrading the user experience.
Different types of updates have different priorities â€” an animation update needs to complete more quickly than,
 say, an update from a data store.
A push-based approach requires the app (you, the programmer) to decide how to schedule work. 
A pull-based approach allows the framework (React) to be smart and make those decisions for you.


What is a fiber?

We've established that a primary goal of Fiber is to enable React to take advantage of scheduling.
 Specifically, we need to be able to

pause work and come back to it later.
assign priority to different types of work.
reuse previously completed work.
abort work if it's no longer needed.
